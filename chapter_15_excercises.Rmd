```{r}

exc_1_str <- c(R"(He said "That's amazing!")",
               r"(\a\b\c\d)",
               r"-(\\\\\\)-"

`\u00a0` encodes a "non breaking space", preventing line breaks or that multiple  
whitespaces gets collapsed into one.

```{r}

x <- "This\u00a0is\u00a0tricky"

x

str_c(x)

```

Tidyverse applies rules when it comes to handling NA and recycling, this results  
in differences in how the strings are handled: 

For the first string, the NA forces the output into NA. For the second, recycling  
is only used for single values and therefore throws an error.

```{r, error = TRUE}

str_c("hi ", NA)
str_c(letters[1:2], letters[1:3])

paste0("hi ", NA)
paste0(letters[1:2], letters[1:3])

```

```{r}

food <- "pizza"
price <- 100
age <- 35
country <- "Sweden"
title <- "asskickery"


tribble(
  ~ input,                                               ~ output,
  str_c("The price of ", food, " is ", price),           str_glue("The price of {food} is {price}"),
  str_glue("I'm {age} years old and live in {country}"), str_c("I'm", age, "years old and live in", country, sep = " "),
  str_c("\\section{", title, "}"),                       str_glue("\\section{{{title}}}")
)

The `babynames` data set reports the observed name for a given year, gender, 
and number of individuals with this specific name. As such, it is necessary  
to specify `wt = n` to get the sum of names with a specific length.

2.

```{r}

babynames |> 
  mutate(
    name_length = str_length(name),
    name_mid_position = if_else(
                          name_length %% 2 == 0, 
                          NA, 
                          ceiling(name_length / 2)
                          ),
    name_mid_letter = str_sub(
                        name, 
                        start = name_mid_position, 
                        end = name_mid_position
                      )
  )

```

```{r}

    name_length = str_length(name),
    name_first_letter = str_sub(name, 1, 1),
    name_last_letter = str_sub(name, -1, -1),
    name_rank = dense_rank(desc(prop)),
