### 6.2.1

1.  


    - `table1` shows data in a tidy format: each observation (row)  represent
    a specific country and year, with the cases and total population in two 
    columns.
    - In `table2`, the `cases` and `population` has been pivoted into a single 
    column
    `type` and their respected values under `count`
    - `table3` offers further customization, with a single column (`ratio`) 
    containing the ratio of `cases` over the `population`.

2. 

    - For `table1`, this is as simple as using the different columns for the 
    calculations.  
    - For `table2`, the operation needs to instead work on the data 
    `group_by(country)` - this will create the same value twice (for the grouped 
    rows).
    - For `table3`, the `rate` column needs to be converted into numeric (from 
    character) and multiplied by 1000.
